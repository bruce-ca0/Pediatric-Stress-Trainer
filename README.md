# Pediatric-Stress-Trainer
Project for the 2023 Next Generation Medical Simulation Hackathon at Queen's University
By: Bruce Cao, Mason Mazzocco, Henry Bruin

# Description
Our group's project was a pediatric stress trainer which allows medical and nursing students to autonomously practice dealing with stress in young children, such as when they are receiving vaccines
## Heart rate graph
The heartrate graph is generated by taking the minimum of range of possible heartbeats and adding or subtracting from it 100 times per second while staying within the range

## Audio detection
The code uses pyAudio to take mic inputs and calculates the volume using the root mean square. 

## Patient Status 
We determined patient status by taking a Simple Moving Average of the past 5 data points and comparing it with medical data on heart rate ranges.
